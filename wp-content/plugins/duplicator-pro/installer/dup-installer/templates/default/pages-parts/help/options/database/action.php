        <b>Create New Database</b><br/> Will attempt to create a new database if it does not exist.  When using the 'Basic' option this
        option will not work on many    hosting providers as the ability to create new databases is normally locked down. If the database
        does not exist then you will need to login to your control panel and create the database.  If your host supports 'cPanel' then you
        can use this option to create a new database after logging in via your  cPanel account.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        <b>Empty Database</b><br/>
        DELETE all tables in the database you are connecting to.  Please make sure you have backups of all your data before using an portion
        of the installer, as this option WILL remove all data.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        <b>Overwrite Existing Tables</b><br/>
        Overwrite only the tables that are extracted.  This option is useful if you want to install WordPress in a database containing other 
        WordPress installations or applications.<br/>
        <i>Note: When performing an install alongside another installation be sure to change the prefix since only those tables with the same prefix be
            overwritten while tables of a different prefix will be retained.</i>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        
        <b>Backup and Rename Existing Tables</b><br/>
        RENAME all tables in the database you are connecting to with a prefix of
        "<?php echo $GLOBALS['DB_RENAME_PREFIX'] ?>".
        <br/>
        <br/>

        <b>Skip Database Extraction</b> <i>(Advanced)</i><br/>
        This option requires that you manually run your own database (SQL) import to an existing database before running the installer.
        When this action is selected the dup-database__[hash].sql file found inside the dup-installer folder of the archive.zip file will NOT be processed. 
        The database your connecting to should already be a valid WordPress installed database.  
        This option is viable when you need to run advanced search and replace options on the database.
